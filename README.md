A simple library for controlling one or more Big Mouth Billy Bass.

This library was conceived from the idea of creating a Halloween prop in which 
one or more Big Mouth Billy Bass singing fish would be able to sing Halloween 
songs and play amusing or 'scary' Halloween sound effects. All the while, the 
fish themselves would be able to mimic the songs/sounds.

Additional information on the wiring and construction can be found in the 
schematics/ folder.
